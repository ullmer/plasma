/**
 * Create a new pool.
 *
 * The pool_name is a URI-sh string that looks like so:
 * @code
 *     [<transport>://hostname[:port]/]<pool_name>
 * @endcode
 *
 * Pool names may contain most printable characters, including '/',
 * although '/' is special since it indicates a subdirectory, just
 * like on the filesystem.  Some other restrictions on pool name:
 *   - the total pool name must be between 1 and 100 characters in length
 *   - a pool name consists of one or more components, separated by slashes
 *   - a component may not be the empty string
 *   - a component may only contain the characters:
 *     " !#$%&'()+,-.0123456789;=@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
 *     "[]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{}~"
 *     (the double quotes are not part of the legal character set)
 *   - a component may not begin with '.', and may not end with '.', ' ',
 *     or '$'
 *   - a component may not be any of the following names, case-insensitively,
 *     nor may it begin with one of these immediately followed by a dot:
 *     CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8,
 *     COM9, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, LPT9,
 *     or lost+found.
 *
 * Pools are uniquely identified by their names, regardless of type.
 *
 * Examples:
 *   - my_pool
 *   - pipeline/gripes
 *   - tcp://localhost/my_pool
 *   - tcp://mango:10000/my_pool
 *
 * The type string specifies what kind of pool you want to create,
 * e.g., "mmap".  This refers to the type of the pool on the host
 * machine, _not_ the transport (e.g., "tcp").  Currently, the
 * transport is specified in the pool name.
 *
 * The \a options slaw may be either a map or a protein, and
 * describes any parameters needed to create the
 * pool, which will vary by the type of pool.  The option format is a
 * protein containing multiple ingests, where the ingest key is the
 * parameter to set and the ingest value is (unsurprisingly) the
 * value of the parameter.  (Or just a slaw map with similar key/value
 * pairs.)  For example, mmap pools need to know what
 * size of pool to create, so to create a pool of size 1048576, you'd
 * pass it an option protein with the ingest "size:1048576".  If no
 * parameters are needed, the options argument is NULL.
 *
 * This function may return, besides the success indicator OB_OK,
 *  - OB_ARGUMENT_WAS_NULL if \a ret_ph is \c NULL.
 *  - OB_NO_MEM on memory allocation errors.
 *  - POOL_INVALID_SIZE if the size specified in
 *    \a options is below or above limits, or is not coercible
 *    to an integer.
 *  - POOL_POOLNAME_BADTH if \a pool_name is ill-formed.
 *  - POOL_TYPE_BADTH if \a type does not name a known
 *    pool type.
 *  - a retort encapsulating an errno in case of a system error
 *    such as a failure to acquire an OS lock.
 *  - POOL_EXISTS if a pool with this name already exists.
 *
 * The possible keys for the options map/protein are documented in
 * \ref PoolOptions
